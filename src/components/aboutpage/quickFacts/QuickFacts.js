            <h3>When I started as a developer</h3>
            <p>
              In 2000, when I did a Level III Certificate Computer Science
              course where I learned Visual Basic and Delphi. Unfortunately, I
              had to put the brakes on it when going to university due to
              personal circumstances, but that is a story for another time... ðŸ“–
            </p>

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>
              I have a BA in Journalism, a Beng in Civil Engineering, a Level IV
              Certificate in Graphic Design, and a Level III Certificate in
              Computer Science. I am working towards a BSc in Computing now.

            <p>
              Cooking (and eating, obviously ðŸ˜‹), watching and playing football,

              to keep fit.

            <h3>Favourite pastimes</h3>

              services ðŸ˜…).
