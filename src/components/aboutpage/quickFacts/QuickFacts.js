          <p>
            In 2000, when I did a Level III Certificate Computer Science course
            where I learned Visual Basic and Delphi. Unfortunately, I had to put

            circumstances, but that is a story for another time... ðŸ“–

            Certificate in Graphic Design, and a Level III Certificate in
