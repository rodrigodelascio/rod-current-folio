            Having come from a diverse background of studies and work
            experiences, I decided to make a career change after over a decade
            working in marketing and as a linguist. Passionate about technology,
            I love adding to my tech stack, improving myself, and been working
            on front-end projects since 2022.

                I have studied the foundations of Computer Science at a young
                age and moved away from the area due to personal circumstances.
                I have achieved a BA in Journalism and a Beng in Civil
                Engineering afterwards.

                I found my way back to computing and as a lifelong learner,
                after recently attending a Software Development Bootcamp, I
                decided to go back to university and enhance my knowledge, to
                become a better professional.

          <h3>When I started as a developer</h3>
          <p>
            In 2000, when I did a Level III Certificate Computer Science course
            where I learned Visual Basic and Delphi. Unfortunately, I had to put
            the brakes on it when going to university due to personal
            circumstances, but that is a long story for another time... ðŸ“–
          </p>

          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>
            I have a BA in Journalism, a Beng in Civil Engineering, a Level IV
            Certificate in Graphic Design, and a Level III Certificate in
            Computer Science. I am working towards a BSc in Computing now.

            keep fit.

          <h3>Favourite pastimes</h3>
          <p>
            Spending time with my family, watching films and tv series (I sign

            services ðŸ˜…).
